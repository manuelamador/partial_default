# Numerical analysis for "Reputation and Partial Default" 

by Manuel Amador and Christopher Phelan. 

This respository contains code that replicates the numerical results of ["Reputation and Partial Default"](https://manuelamador.me/files/reputationpartial.pdf) by Manuel Amador and Christopher Phelan. 

## Description

The code is in Julia. The code was run using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) 1.7.0. 


1. The directory `src` contains the main source code. 

2. The directory `scripts` contains the script that generates the figures presented in the paper. 

   Running either `paper_figures.jl` or `paper_figures.ipynb` runs the simulation and saves the figures.  These scripts will automatically download the Julia packages that are needed. 

3. The directory `output` contains the figures.
